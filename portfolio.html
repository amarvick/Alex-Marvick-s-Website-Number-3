			<h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>

			<p>Here is a list of some projects that I have worked on in my own individual time. Each are organized by
			   language, and code is available here! I'll get it on my <a href="http://www.github.com/amarvick">Github</a> 
			   profile soon.</p>

		<!--JAVA-->
			
			<h1>JAVA</h1>

			<p>So I actually decided to pick up on Java just a few days after Christmas because
				I realized that in order to be a powerful web developer, front and back end languages are both very 
				essential. Amongst the few languages I could have learned; Java, PHP, Ruby, Scala, etc. I just had a nitch
				to learn Java since I know how powerful it is and it's a great way to learn OOP. I only have one program
				written in it so far, but it was a valuable learning experience and I hope to get even better at it
				soon and perhaps learn those other languages mentioned above!</p>
				


			<h3>BANKING GAME</h3>

			<p>In this game, two different classes are used; one being the program itself 
				that imports the other class, where all of the functions are represented. The computer prompts you 
				that you have $10000, and it asks how much of it you'd like to store in your checking and savings 
				account with the remainder in your pockets. The computer will continually give you a menu asking what 
				you'd like to do with your money; either make a deposit, withdrawal, transfer between accounts, check 
				balances, or quit. There are some other options as well included that haven't been edited yet (you'll 
				notice a luck option and an option to check your items), and I'm not sure how I'm going to make those 
				parts but it's there for making the game more interesting. It's great extra practice, too.</p>

		<!--HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT/jQuery-->
			

			<hr>


			<h1>HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT &amp; JQUERY</h1>

			<p>These languages were picked up in the summer of 2015. I consider Front-End Development my biggest focus as of now.
			   While there is a lot more to learn, I hope that this provides a great starting point for my self-taught endeavors 
			   for anyone who takes a look. Projects labeled with an asterisk * have a link to redirect you to by clicking on the 
			   title.</p>
			


			<h3><a href="http://www.alexmarvick.com">ALEX MARVICK'S WEBSITE (THIS ONE, TAKE THREE)*</a></h3>

			<p>Though I really liked the website I had before hand, I decided to remake a new website with new concepts in mind, and a
			   goal to implement more design techniques; especially media queries. I'm currently still making
			   some modifications to it, so I don't have code on Github yet; but I hope you like what you see.</p>

		    <h3><a href="http://www.jaboodahomesinc.com">JABOODA HOMES, INC*</a></h3>

		    <p>Jabooda Homes, Inc. is a construction firm based out of Mercer Island, WA., whose owners have a great relationship with 
		       my parents and gave me a chance to develop their website, despite still being somewhat of a new programmer. This was one 
		       of my proudest pieces not only due to design, but because of the relationship I made with my client and being able to work
		       with somebody rather than completing this individually. Check it out!</p>

		    <h3>CONTACT FORM</h3>

		    <p>A simple contact form that asks for all fields to be inputted, and will prompt any errors the user would have made. These
		       include a mismatch of passwords, a missing field, etc.</p>
		    <p id="github"><a href="https://github.com/amarvick/Contact-Form">Check it out on Github!</a></p>


		    <h3><a href="http://www.alexmarvick.com/gallery.html">IMAGE GALLERY SLIDER*</a></h3>
		    <p>A simple image gallery slider which scrolls through several images I posted of my choice. You can also see this in the gallery
		       section, as I originally made this before importing a similar gallery with better design. The code is very similar in terms of
		       the elements I used; just different numbers, colors and overall design. Also, The one on this website looks good on a mobile device.</p>

		    <h3><a href="http://www.alexmarvick.com/resume.html">ANIMATED RESUME*</a></h3>
		    <p>You can see this on the 'resume' section of my website, though it needs work with media queries. This was a great project as 
		    it taught me more about animations and it was a creative way to express myself and my abilities. Again, it needs work regarding scaling,
		    which was why I got rid of the viewport tag in that page. I originally created this as a side project separate from the website, then
		    had to embed all of it in to the website. In that process, I had to modify the CSS code a little bit, but it is very similar.</p>

			<h3>ALEX MARVICK'S WEBSITE (TAKE TWO)</h3>

			<p>After the first website when I realized I wasn't going too far with my first website, I decided
				to start over and make this one instead. In my opinion, this take was significantly more successful; but again,
				the first one was a great start as it helped me figure out what went wrong and gave me the motivation to make
				those changes and put more care in to it.</p>

			<h3>REDDIT API</a></h3>

			<p>This was a fun project I worked on with my brother on how to use the Reddit API
				via JavaScript. This program imports Reddit's JSON, and it shows the four most recent headings for different
				sections, depending on what you look up. For example, if you type 'aww' in the search box, JavaScript will
				find the first four most recent 'aww' articles and post their names, and can do this for any of the other
				headings searched.</p>

			<h3>BBC NEWS WEBSITE REPLICATION</h3>

			<p>While it's not 100% finished, I did this for fun on August 31, 2015 and haven't 
				updated it since. (I bet people who read BBC are wondering when it'll be updated next...) It looks almost
				100% like the original website (obviously disregarding some of the sections missing), and hey, if you want
				to read those articles you see on there, it'll link you directly to them! (Except for the one about me...)
				This was done explicitly using HTML and CSS. Note that As this was one of my first projets, I did not take 
				media queries in to account and it may therefore not look attractive on mobile.</p>

		<!--C++-->
		   
			<h1>C++</h1>

			<p>As this was the first language I decided to pick up, I can say that I had a pretty 
				darn good time. These projects are all pretty rudimentary, and hopefully you can have some fun with the games, 
				even if they aren't the best of quality. I have over 40 of these, so I'll post the ones that I think were pretty 
				significant to my learning as I had just gotten started. I realize people probably don't care about my first 
				"Hello World" project -- and I wanted to pick ones that you'd have fun actually looking at. Additionally, because
				I had completed these a long time ago (between March-June 2015), they likely do not reflect what I am able to do now.
				However, it represents my starting point, and they may actually be a bit of fun. (Note: none of these are on Github yet,
				so the links will direct you back to the home page. You've been warned!)</p>
			


			<h3>Hangman: Vectors</h3>

			<p>I think this will be the most appealing for any user who is just looking to play a fun game.
				This game has many different random words that could possibly be pulled out, and you can guess incorrectly
				up to 8 times before you become hung. This was done by using the basic concepts of vectors, while loops and
				if/else statements.</p>
			<p id="github"><a href="">Check it out on Github!</a></p>


			<h3>The MasterQuest</h3>

			<p>Perhaps one of the more fun projects I've worked on, this game requires the user to log in to
				the server to begin. There are only a few accounts that I've made available for people; therefore, you will
				have to sign in as a 'guest'. This won't impact the journey you'll be taking, however. All you have to do is
				input 'guest' for either the username or the password. This portion of the program uses the fundamentals of
				logical operators (&amp;&amp;, || and !=), while the actual journey that you'll be taking uses a combination of do loops,
				if/then statements, switch/case options as well as break/continue statements. There is a maximum possible score
				in this game -- if you play this and let me know what that maximum score is, that's cool!</p>
			<p id="github"><a href="">Check it out on Github!</a></p>


			<h3>The Number Guessing Game</h3>

			<p>In this game, a random number is selected to be guessed and you must be the first one to find
				that number before the computer. This enables the random number generator, as well as using some do loops. I guess
				I like them better than while loops, but I know the significance between each -- do loops will operate at least once,
				whereas while loops may not operate at all. Created: April 2015</p>

			<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>

			<p> This was my first Tic-Tac-Toe game written ever using the basic concepts of arrays. It's pretty 
				fun; it may not be as advanced or as sophisticated as Bill Gates's first Tic-Tac-Toe game he wrote when he was just
				learning how to code, but I still think you'd have fun with it. Unfortunately, for some reason I can't get the 
				program to settle in on a winner/tiebreaker as it will continue going once all the spaces are filled up. I may 
				change this eventually. Created: March 2015</p>

			<h3>Word Scramble: Iterators and Vectors</h3>
			
			<p>In this Word Scramble game, this uses vectors as well as some of its operations
				for the user to guess the word. There are only four words available; if you can figure out what they were, 
				cool...</p>
			<p id="github"><a href="">Check it out on Github!</a></p>		
			   

			<h3>CYLINDRICAL &amp; SPHERICAL COORDINATES CONVERSION CALCULATOR</h3>
			
			<p>In Calculus, you have the ability to take regular cartesian coordinates (x, y and z on a 3-dimensional
				plane) and convert them in to Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates. In both of these coordinate systems, you can
				think of creating a coordinate point on the edge of a Cylinder or a Sphere. To see how the calculations actually work,
				you'd have to read the code -- but if you're doing this unit in Calculus III and need to check your answers, feel
				free to do so with this program. Created: January 2015 (My first simple formal program made)</p>
